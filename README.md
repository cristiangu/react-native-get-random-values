[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@korekoi/react-native-get-random-values?color=blue&style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@korekoi/react-native-get-random-values)

### Features

- ðŸ«³ Drop-in replacement for `crypto.getRandomValues`
- âš¡ Uses JSI for faster operations  between Native and JS
- ðŸ”’ Native C++ secure randomization using [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)

### Installation

```sh
npm install @korekoi/react-native-get-random-values
```

#### Dependencies

This library needs these dependencies to be installed in your project before you can use it:

```sh
npm install react-native-nitro-modules
```

### Usage

```typescript
import "@korekoi/react-native-get-random-values"

const array = new Uint8Array(32);
global.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
```


> See the [example app](./example/)

### How does it compare to other alternatives?

The most downloaded and probably the only available library to polyfill this method (until now) has been [LinusU/react-native-get-random-values](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values), but our solution has a couple improvements:

- **JSI**, Native and JavaScript communicate through a memory reference and not by serializing data in Base64 back-and-forth, which results in faster operations
- Randomization is made using [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) for both iOS and Android
  - instead of [Java SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html) for Android and [Objective-C SecRandomCopyBytes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secrandomcopybytes(_:_:_:)?language=objc) or [Swift SecRandomCopyBytes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secrandomcopybytes(_:_:_:)) for iOS

### Benchmark
